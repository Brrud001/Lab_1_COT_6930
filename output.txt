Which variation did you like the most? (Enter the number, or 0 if none): 1
Provide feedback for the next iteration (or press Enter to continue without feedback): I liked that variation 1 focused on gen AI, and more specifically focused on utilizing pre-trained models as we do not have much time to trian our own models from scratch. One concern I have still though is while I like both the privacy policy summarizer and the real-time phishing detector, I'm not clear on how we would bundle those two things into a singular extension because they feel like they are different. They are both in the realm of cybersecurity, but users might be confused about why the extension offers those two unlike things. Any thoughts on how to unify them in an extension that users would actually want to use?

Which variation did you like the most? (Enter the number, or 0 if none): 2
Provide feedback for the next iteration (or press Enter to continue without feedback): I liked 2 the most because the other variations talked about a dashboard, which I think doesn't fit well with the concept of an extnesion nor the idea that this is something we want to deliver quickly. Keep the visual indicators minimal, such as tooltips or other small interfaces, will be much more in-line with a browser extension experience. It should be as unobtrusive as possible while still assiting the end-user. A dashboard would be something that would only interest a small subset of tech-minded people, and we want this extension to be accessible to everyone. I espeically like the theme of "getting phished and unknowingly agreeing to unfavorable privacy terms" because often a part of getting phished is due to people clicking an accept button on something they did not read at all.
